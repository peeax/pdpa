# Thai PDPA Website (Unofficial)

The content on this website is based on [the official document of Thailand's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) B.E. 2562](http://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2562/A/069/T_0052.PDF).

The website represents PDPA in a new format using interactive stacked pages and wiki-links, built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (licensed under MIT).

The goal is to provide ease of access to PDPA and allow tracking of article references. Users can open referenced articles on the side portion of the desktop screen or landscape tablet (not on mobile or narrow screen).
